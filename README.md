## Some KPI'S
```sql
--Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Sale FROM fact_sales;

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard covers:
- KPIs: Total Sales, Units Sold, Discounts
- Trendlines for MoM analysis
- Regional Performance
- Customer Analysis

> You can find the `.pbix` file in the `PowerBI/` folder.

---

## Advance Analysis
1. **Repeat Customer ID**

*Try this to View the Repeated Customer*

```sql
SELECT 
    fs.customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT d.month + d.year * 100) AS active_months
FROM fact_sales fs
JOIN dim_dates d ON fs.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY fs.customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT d.month + d.year * 100) > 1;
```
---
2. **Repeat customer Vs One-Time Customer**

   *WE will visualize This one On PBI*

```sql
WITH customer_months AS (
    SELECT 
        fs.customer_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT d.month + d.year * 100) AS active_months
    FROM fact_sales fs
    JOIN dim_dates d ON fs.date_id = d.date_id
    GROUP BY fs.customer_id
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN active_months > 11 THEN 'Repeat Customer'
        ELSE 'One-Time Customer'
    END AS customer_type,
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customer_months
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN active_months > 11 THEN 'Repeat Customer'
        ELSE 'One-Time Customer'
    END;
```

**PBI Visual**

Repeat vs One-Time Customers

üî® Steps:

Create a calculated column in Power BI on fact_sales:

**DAX**

Purchase_Month = FORMAT(dim_dates[date], "YYYY-MM")


*Create a summary table:*

**DAX**

CustomerMonthCount = 
SUMMARIZE(
    fact_sales,
    fact_sales[customer_id],
    "MonthsPurchased", DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_sales[Purchase_Month])
)
Create a calculated column on that table:

**DAX**

CustomerType = 
IF([MonthsPurchased] > 1, "Repeat Customer", "One-Time Customer")

---
**Create a Donut Chart or Bar Chart:**

Axis: CustomerType

Values: Count of customer_id

‚úîÔ∏è This will now visually match the SQL output.

**‚úÖ Create Views (Reusable Layers for BI Tools)**
```sql
CREATE VIEW vw_monthly_category_sales AS
SELECT 
    d.year,
    d.month,
    c.category_name,
    SUM(fs.total_price) AS monthly_sales
FROM fact_sales fs
JOIN dim_dates d ON fs.date_id = d.date_id
JOIN dim_products p ON fs.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN dim_categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY d.year, d.month, c.category_name;
```

Then Select This Line and Execute-To View the Result .
```sql
SELECT * FROM vw_monthly_category_sales;
 ```

**üìà Year-over-Year Revenue Growth**
```sql
CREATE VIEW vw_yearly_revenue AS
SELECT 
    d.year,
    SUM(fs.total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM fact_sales fs
JOIN dim_dates d ON fs.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY d.year;
```
Then Select This Line and Execute-To View the Result .
```sql
SELECT * FROM vw_yearly_revenue
```

![]()
---

**To Calculate Growth Year By Year In percentage(Previous Year To Current Year**
```sql
SELECT 
    curr.year,
    curr.total_revenue,
    prev.total_revenue AS previous_year_revenue,
    ROUND(((curr.total_revenue - prev.total_revenue) * 100.0) / NULLIF(prev.total_revenue, 0), 2) AS growth_percentage
FROM vw_yearly_revenue curr
LEFT JOIN vw_yearly_revenue prev ON curr.year = prev.year + 1
ORDER BY curr.year;
```

1. **Month-over-month sales growth**
2. **Rolling 3-month average revenue**
3. **Customer retention & segmentation**

## üìÅ Sample Advanced SQL Queries

```sql
-- Rolling 3-Month Average Sales
SELECT 
    d.year, d.month,
    SUM(fs.total_price) AS sales,
    AVG(SUM(fs.total_price)) OVER (
        ORDER BY d.year, d.month 
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS rolling_avg
FROM fact_sales fs
JOIN dim_dates d ON fs.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY d.year, d.month;
